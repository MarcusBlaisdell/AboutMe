        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p class="p2">This was a fantastic experience. I had an opportunity to work in a lab with four PhD students
        under a research professor. The REU program provided weekly talks to help students learn more about
        conducting research.
        <br>I did not get any strong positive results from my research during the two months of the program.
        Fortunately, as a WSU student, I was able to contine working on this problem for the remainder of the
        year with Professor Doppa in addition to my regular classes.
        <br>By December, I had exhausted every idea I had to achieve results and did not make any significant
        progress beyond what I did in the first two months. I used every resource I could access, I spoke with
        Professor Doppa, with every PhD student in the lab, with every PhD student I knew in the building, I
        scoured the library for relevant work, I Googled every search term and phrase I could think of, I read
        many papers and tried many variations of my algorithms, all to no avail. I gave this project everything
        I had and did not find answers to my research questions. As Professor Doppa then told me, with research,
        There are no guarantees. This may be possible, it may not be. All I could say at that time was that the
        methods I tried did not yield strong results.
        <br>This was a great experience for me and I am very glad I got to do it. I learned a lot and I use that
        knowledge every day and expect that it will continue to serve me well in my future endeavors.
        <br>I still ponder on this from time to time and try to think of ways to make progress. My mind does not
        like to give up on unfinished problems and I still hold out hope that someday, I will come across a new
        piece of information that will trigger the inspiration that will let me solve this.

        <p class="p2">Research project to investigate the use of text prediction software
        combined with an eye-tracking, virtual, text-to-speech keyboard to enable paralyzed users to communicate faster.
        <br>With a specific interest in helping patients of ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, aka, Lou Gehrig's disease)
        sponsored in part by <a class="color-link" href="https://teamgleason.org/">Team Gleason</a>, we worked to use technology

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p class="p2">This was my first opportunity to learn about conducting research. I was able to write code
          necessary to the success of the project. I was able to learn about the ethical responsibilities of a researcher
          to safeguard the participants data and mental well-being. I certified through WSU to be a researcher conducting human trials through the WSU Internal Review Board (IRB).
          <br>I was able to conduct two rounds of human trials allowing me to learn how to interact with and observe study participants
          to collect the relevant statistical information required to evaluate the effectiveness of the tool were were developing.
          The tool showed great promise in significantly decreasing the amount of time required for users to enter entire sentences
          of text to anable them to continue to converse near normal speed with others. I got this opportunity through the WSU Robotics Club
          which Dr. Taylor was the advisor. He told me that he recognized me as someone who "gets things done" through my work as the club
          Vice President and invited me to work with him on this project.
          <br>I greatly enjoyed this opportunity and am thankful to both Dr. Taylor and Dr. Matuszek for everything I learned by working with them.

      <h2>Why did I leave SEL?</h2>
      <p class="p2">SEL is a great company and my job as a Quality Technician was a great job. It just wasn’t the job I wanted to do. I have always loved computer programming and my longing to do that as my career became much greater than my desire to continue working with a great team of talented and friendly people and I was compelled to return to school to earn my degree in computer science and pursue the career I always wanted.
      As to why I have not returned to SEL now that I have my degree since they do offer many wonderful opportunities for CS grads, I personally prefer the Seattle area to the Palouse region. I am a city person and Pullman is a small town. I was not able to enjoy my desired lifestyle in Pullman. I did not so much leave SEL behind as I left Pullman behind and SEL was a collateral loss. It is much to the credit of the company and my former coworkers that I stayed there as long as I did. Were it not for the wonderful people I worked with every day, I would have left much sooner.

      <h2>Why did I leave Agilent Technologies?</h2>
      <p class="p2">In 2003, it was announced that our factory was shutting down and all of our work was to move to Malaysia. It was a sign of the times. This was common among manufacturing facilities and now it was our turn. I did have the distinction of being the last production member on site. My supervisor was let go before I was and the General Manager left before I did. It was a busy year. I spent a lot of time disconnecting hardware and watching it get packaged up to be shipped overseas. I was given the task of formatting every production PC and reinstalling OS and software prior to shipping. That was almost two months of nothing but formatting and loading from imaged drives. Eventually, the last computer was formatted and shipped off and I was left on board for one additional month to answer any questions from the new teams setting things up. Once the new factory was declared up and running, I was officially laid off.
To coin a phrase, I did not leave Agilent, Agilent left me. I bear no ill will. I understand this was a business decision. I was told that on average, they were paying the Malaysians 1/17 of what they were paying us. You can’t compete with that and expect to remain viable in a global market.
<p class="p2">Would I go back to Hewelett Packard? Absolutely!
<br>Would I go back to Agilent Technologies or their spinoff, Keysight? Yes, definitely.
<br>I loved the company(ies) and the work I did with it/them.</p>
