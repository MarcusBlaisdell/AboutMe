        <p class="p2">
          When I first started working in the MorphoGenesis lab, there were two students from the Research Experience for Undergraduates, REU, program
          working for Professor Ghandi. Officially, they reported to a PhD student who was serving as their mentor. He would meet with them weekly to
          check on their progress and offer guidance.
          <br>Since I was in the lab every day working next to them, they would ask me questions and I would help them get started on their projects.
          As the summer progressed, I was helping them more and more by pointing them to tutorials they needed to learn the skills they needed and
          was looking over their code to offer help so they could continue to make progress. I became their defacto mentor and they began reporting
          to me.

          <p class="p2">
            With my guidance:
          <br>- One student was able to:
          <ul class="tab">
            <li>Build an LSTM RNN and use it to make predictions using neurological data collected from an
            EEG device.</li>
            <li>Use multiple microcontollers connected via serial to control a kinetic sculpture</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
          - One student built:
          <ul class="tab">
            <li >Temperature and Humidity recorder that would record temperature and humidity throughout the day and save the data to a text file</li>
            <li>Custom solenoids for a kinetic sculpture</li>
            <li>Learned to etch copper to make custom circuit boards</li>
          </ul>
